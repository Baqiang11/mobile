Mobile Communications Experiment: NOMA vs OMA
Project Overview
This project investigates the characteristics of mobile communication systems by simulating different modulation techniques, channel models, and access methods using MATLAB and Simulink. The focus is on comparing Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) with Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA) in Rayleigh fading channels. The project includes analysis of Bit Error Rate (BER) and channel capacity under various signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and modulation schemes.

Key Features
Modulation Schemes:
Simulation of M-PSK and M-QAM modulation techniques, including BPSK, QPSK, 8-PSK, and 16-PSK under different noise conditions like AWGN and Rayleigh fading.
Multipath Fading Channels:
Use of Rayleigh fading models to simulate the effects of multipath propagation, with analysis of flat fading and frequency-selective fading characteristics.
Channel Coding:
Implementation and comparison of Hamming and BCH coding for improving the reliability of data transmission in noisy channels.
Diversity Techniques:
Investigation of spatial diversity using a 1x2 SIMO system with BPSK modulation, showing how diversity can improve signal reception under multipath fading conditions.
NOMA vs OMA:
Detailed comparison of NOMA and OMA in terms of BER and capacity. NOMA utilizes power domain multiplexing to allow multiple users to share the same spectrum, whereas OMA allocates different resources to each user.
Simulation Results
BER Analysis: NOMA shows improved spectral efficiency in high SNR conditions but requires more complex error correction and power allocation techniques.
Channel Capacity: NOMA outperforms OMA as SNR increases, demonstrating better utilization of spectral resources.
